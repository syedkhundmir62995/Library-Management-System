- A library management system keeps track of the books present in the library, thier quantity, who borrowed a particular book, at what date and what is the expected date of book return. It is an important piece of software which is a must at schools and colleges. I have built a library management system using complete OOP's concepts in Python. Instead of database, I have used built-in data structures for storing the data.
